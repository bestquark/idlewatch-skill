- ✅ **Feature/bugs status:** no new regressions observed; host + packaged OpenClaw gates remain stable and release-gate sequencing changes are effective.
- ✅ **OpenClaw integration checks:** `validate:firebase-emulator-mode` still passes.
- ⚠️ **OpenClaw integration gap persists:** `validate:firebase-write-required-once` still blocked by missing write credentials (`FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` + service-account setup).
- ⚠️ **DMG packaging risk persists:** `validate:trusted-prereqs` still blocked by missing `MACOS_CODESIGN_IDENTITY` / `MACOS_NOTARY_PROFILE`.

### Notes

- ✅ **Commit status:** QA log documentation only this cycle.

## QA cycle update — 2026-02-24 07:15 America/Toronto

### Completed this cycle

- ✅ **Monitoring reliability + packaging coverage:** added host OpenClaw release-gate execution to the trusted release workflow (`.github/workflows/release-macos-trusted.yml`) so release checks now include both host and packaged resilience validation before artifact upload.
  - Host gate: `npm run validate:openclaw-release-gates --silent`
  - Packaged gate: `npm run validate:packaged-openclaw-release-gates:reuse-artifact --silent`
- ✅ **Packaging docs update:** clarified trusted release OpenClaw guardrail sequencing in `docs/packaging/macos-dmg.md` to explicitly list host + packaged OpenClaw gate stages.
- ✅ **Validation:** `npm run validate:openclaw-release-gates --silent` ✅

### Notes

- ✅ **Commit status:** release workflow + packaging docs + QA log update completed.

## QA cycle update — 2026-02-24 06:58 America/Toronto

### Completed this cycle

- ✅ **CI packaging reliability improvement:** aligned host OpenClaw smoke checks with the updated release-gate semantics by replacing the two separate host checks (`openclaw-cache-recovery-e2e` + `openclaw-stats-ingestion`) with a single `validate:openclaw-release-gates --silent` step in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
  - This ensures CI validates host OpenClaw coverage in one place: **usage-health, stats ingestion, and stale-cache recovery**.
- ✅ **Monitoring/ingestion confidence:** this removes partial gate drift where usage-health could be untested in host CI smoke while still being required in release validation.
- ✅ **Validation:** `npm run test:unit` ✅ (**267 pass, 0 fail**) and `npm run validate:openclaw-release-gates --silent` ✅.

### Notes

- ✅ **Commit status:** CI workflow updated + QA log entry completed.

## QA cycle update — 2026-02-24 06:45 America/Toronto

### Completed this cycle

- ✅ **Monitoring reliability:** added a new host OpenClaw health validation stage to the release gate so `parseOpenClawUsage` health behavior is now explicitly validated in `validate:openclaw-release-gates` in addition to stats fallback + cache recovery.
- ✅ **Packaging scripts/docs:** added `validate:openclaw-usage-health` validator and wired it into host release validation (`scripts/validate-openclaw-release-gates.mjs`, `package.json`). Updated `README.md` + `docs/packaging/macos-dmg.md` to document the host + packaged coverage split.
- ✅ **Validation:** ran `npm run validate:openclaw-release-gates --silent` and `npm run validate:openclaw-release-gates:all --silent` successfully.

### Notes

- ✅ **Commit status:** parser/docs/scripting updates completed and ready for push.

## QA cycle update — 2026-02-24 06:35 America/Toronto

### Completed this cycle

- ✅ **Monitoring reliability:** finalized deterministic OpenClaw usage arbitration by adding explicit recency-aware tie-breaker in `parseOpenClawUsage` and removing early-score short-circuiting.
- ✅ **Regression coverage:** added fixture + test `openclaw-mixed-equal-score-status-vs-generic-newest.txt` / `prefers most recent candidate when scores tie` to lock in stable behavior when mixed status/generic payloads return equal-confidence candidates.
- ✅ **Packaging docs:** clarified release-gate docs so both `README.md` and `docs/packaging/macos-dmg.md` explicitly document the `:reuse-artifact` release wrapper behavior (health + stats + cache-recovery checks).
- ✅ **Validation:** `npm run test:unit` ✅ (**267 pass, 0 fail**).

### Notes

- ✅ **Commit status:** parser arbitration + tests + docs + QA log updated.

## QA cycle update — 2026-02-24 06:25 America/Toronto

### Completed this cycle

- ✅ **Monitoring reliability:** improved OpenClaw usage parser arbitration in `parseOpenClawUsage`:
  - added timestamp-aware tie-breaking when score is equal between status and generic candidates,
  - preserved source preference and kept candidate selection deterministic for mixed-output scenarios,
  - removed premature-return behavior so the highest-confidence usage candidate always wins.
- ✅ **Packaging docs hardening:** aligned OpenClaw release-gate documentation with artifact-reuse behavior.
  - `README.md` now explicitly documents `validate:packaged-openclaw-release-gates:reuse-artifact` as the artifact-reuse execution path.
  - `docs/packaging/macos-dmg.md` now lists that wrapper as including health + stats + cache-recovery reusable checks.
- ✅ **Coverage:** added fixture + regression test `prefers most recent candidate when scores tie` (`test/fixtures/openclaw-mixed-equal-score-status-vs-generic-newest.txt`).
- ✅ **Validation:** `npm run test:unit` ✅ (**267 pass, 0 fail**)

### Notes

- ✅ **Commit status:** parser arbitration fix + tests + docs + QA log update completed.

## QA cycle update — 2026-02-24 06:16 America/Toronto

### Completed this cycle

- ✅ **Monitoring reliability:** improved mixed-output candidate determinism by preferring the most recent candidate when both status and generic usage interpretations yield equal confidence.
- ✅ **Test hardening:** added fixture/test `openclaw-mixed-equal-score-status-vs-generic-newest.txt` and `prefers most recent candidate when scores tie`.
- ✅ **Validation:** `npm run test:unit` ✅ (**265 pass, 0 fail**)

### Notes

- ✅ **Commit status:** parser arbitration update + regression fixture/test + QA log entry completed.

## QA cycle update — 2026-02-24 06:09 America/Toronto

### Completed this cycle

- ✅ **OpenClaw parser reliability:** added timestamp-aware candidate arbitration in `parseOpenClawUsage`, ensuring newer stronger records are kept when status and generic candidates otherwise tie.
- ✅ **Regression coverage:** added fixture `openclaw-mixed-equal-score-status-vs-generic-newest.txt` and test `prefers most recent candidate when scores tie` for deterministic last-write-wins behavior on equal-score candidates.
- ✅ **Validation:** `npm run test:unit` and `npm run validate:all --silent` both passed.

### Notes

- ✅ **Commit status:** parser + fixture + test + QA log update completed.
